# 🚀 ASP.NET Core Web API – Beginner Friendly Guide for MVC Developers

Welcome! 👋
This project is created **for developers who are familiar with ASP.NET MVC** and are now stepping into the world of **Web APIs**.
If you're used to working with `Controllers`, `Views`, and `Razor Pages`, and you're wondering where the `View()` went — don't worry, you're in the right place!

---

## 🧠 What is this?

This is a **sample ASP.NET Core Web API project**. It's a backend application that returns **data only** (usually JSON), and **does not render HTML views** like traditional MVC apps.

Think of it like this:

| MVC                               | API                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Returns HTML views (View\.cshtml) | Returns JSON or XML                                                      |
| Used for web pages                | Used for mobile apps, frontend JavaScript (React, Blazor, Angular), etc. |
| Works with Razor Views            | Works with HTTP clients (Postman, Axios, HttpClient, etc.)               |

## 📦 Tools to Explore APIs

* **Swagger UI** – Auto-generated docs at `/swagger`
* **Postman** – For testing APIs
* **curl / HttpClient / Fetch / Axios** – For making requests from code

---

## 🙋 Why APIs Matter?

Because:

* They power **mobile apps**
* They allow **JavaScript frontends** to talk to the server
* They are the foundation of **microservices**
* They're **lightweight and fast**
